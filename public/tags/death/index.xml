      <description>Just stumbled on to a article in Medium.com which is related to the current title.
It just got me thinking about what I might need to do with my digital estates/assets.
Using the search engine, I stumble upon various articles that covers this very topic. The following links do cover the various thoughts and concerns that people have thought of. I personally do favor the last 2 links for less marketed and more general opinions towards the topic.</description>

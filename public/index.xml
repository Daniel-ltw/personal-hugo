      <description>Had a read on Medium this morning and saw an article that relates to autonomous driving.
Eon uses Comma.AI OpenPilot project to help automate your vehicle. You have to hook it up to your vehicle&amp;rsquo;s CAN bus/ODB2 system to allow it to detect and maneuver the vehicle for you, this is only possible if your vehicle has Adaptive Cruise Control. Eon uses a front facing dashcam to capture what is happening on the road in front of your vehicle and the algorithm will do it&amp;rsquo;s job in telling the vehicle what to do.</description>
